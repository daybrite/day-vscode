# Day for VS Code

Build and run [Day](https://daybrite.dev) apps — cross-platform native UI in Rust — across one or more
targets, straight from VS Code. It's a thin, conventional wrapper over the `day` CLI: each launch runs
as a VS Code **Task** in its own integrated terminal, so output is native (ANSI colors intact) and
filtered per target, and processes stop/restart through the standard task lifecycle.

## Features

- **Day sidebar** — pick a project, tick one or more targets, and Run / Build. Targets your host can't
  build (e.g. `windows-*` on macOS) are shown disabled.
- **Multiple simultaneous targets** — each selected target launches in its own terminal and can be
  **stopped / restarted independently** (inline buttons, or the status bar).
- **Build mode** (debug / release), **locale** (`--locale`), and an optional **dayscript**
  (`--script`) — all editable from the sidebar or command palette.
- **`day` task type** — auto-detected `day: build <target>` / `day: run <target>` tasks integrate with
  the Tasks system, `Ctrl+Shift+B`, and key bindings. Build errors surface via the `$rustc` matcher.
- **Doctor** — run `day doctor` to check your toolchains.

## Requirements

The `day` CLI:

```bash
cargo install day-cli
```

Set `day.cliPath` to your `day` binary. If it's not on `PATH` **and** the workspace is
the Day repository (a Cargo workspace with a `day-cli` member), the extension automatically falls back
to `cargo run -q -p day-cli --`, so it works in-repo with no installed binary.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `day.cliPath` | `day` | Path to the `day` CLI (falls back to `cargo run -p day-cli --` in the Day repo). |
| `day.defaultProfile` | `debug` | Default build mode. |
| `day.defaultLocale` | `""` | Default `--locale` (empty = app/system default). |
| `day.extraEnv` | `{}` | Extra `KEY=VALUE` env passed to every launch via `--env`. |
| `day.ohosNdkHome` | `""` | OpenHarmony NDK `native` dir for `ohos-arkui` (exported as `OHOS_NDK_HOME` in the task; empty = auto-detect `~/ohos/ndk-extract/native` or `~/ohos-sdk/native`; the SDK's `toolchains/` joins the task PATH for `hdc`). |

## Developing this extension

```bash
npm install
npm run compile   # or: npm run watch
```

Press **F5** (Run → "Run Day Extension") to open an Extension Development Host. Open any Day
project (a folder with a `day.yaml` — `day new app my-app` makes one); the **Day** sidebar
lists the app and its targets — tick `macos-appkit`, click **Run**, and the app launches in a
terminal. Tick a second target to run both at once; use the inline stop/restart buttons per
target. `npx @vscode/vsce package` produces an installable `.vsix`.

Releases: pushing a `v*` tag builds, packages, and publishes to the Visual Studio Marketplace
and Open VSX (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`). The extension's release cycle is independent of
[day](https://github.com/daybrite/day)'s — it drives whatever `day` CLI is installed.
